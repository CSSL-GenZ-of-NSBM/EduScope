  author: ObjectId (User reference)
  authorName: string
  authorFaculty: string
  status: ContentStatus (pending/approved/rejected)
  votes: number
  votedBy: ObjectId[] (User references)
  tags: string[] (max 10 tags)
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  feasibility: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  expectedOutcome: string (max 500 chars)
  targetAudience: string[]
  resourcesNeeded: string[]
  isImplemented: boolean
  implementationDetails?: string
  viewCount: number
  // ... and more fields for comprehensive tracking
}
```

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The ideas feature is now fully functional and ready for use with:
